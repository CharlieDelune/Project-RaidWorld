# Project RaidWorld

## What is this?

I want to get back into Unity development. I've missed it for so long and I've wanted to do some work. I had this idea for a game that seemed small enough (for once) that I might actually be able to pull something off.

## Okay, so what *is* this?

Project Raidworld is what happens when you take Rimworld and distill it down to *just* the raids. 

It's a tower defense game in which you can build your path and force your enemies (the raiders) to take the path of most resistance.

You can hire more colonists and build more defenses using the currency you earn during each wave of raiders.

You have control over where the colonists go and what they do, but be warned... they're never *safe*.

## Can I play it yet?

Nope, but stay tuned, this ReadMe will be updated when it's playable.

## What's the roadmap look like?

Well, the closest thing I have to a roadmap right now is the [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/TR7Oqx4u/project-raidworld) for the project. The is the first time I've used a board like this for a personal project, but I think it's a good thing to use to keep my thoughts and plans organized.
